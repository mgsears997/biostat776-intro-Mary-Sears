# Introducing Myself
This website contains a short introduction of Mary Sears.


# About Me:


Hi! I'm a second-year MHS student in Genetic Epidemiology. I graduated with my BA in English Literature from Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, in 2019. My research interests include host genetics, infectious disease epidemiology, and malnutrition and enteric infections. I have a lot of experience using Stata and some experience using R. I have taken Statistical Methods 1-4 at JHSPH. I am excited to improve my R skills in this course.

# Five fun facts about me:

1. I love literature. As an undergrad, I was an English Literature major, and I did my senior thesis on Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse and Mrs Dalloway.

2. I have three younger siblings.

3. My family has a brown toy poodle named Maggie.

4. Every summer, I spend a couple of weeks at my family's house on Deer Lake in Grand Rapids, MN. This year, my cousin got a video of a family of black bears right outside the house's front door!

5. My favorite desserts are strawberry ice cream and anything with meringue in it.
