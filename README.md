# Introducing Myself
This website contains a short introduction of Mary Sears.


# About Me:


Hi! I'm a second-year MHS student in Genetic Epidemiology. I have a lot of experience using Stata and some experience using R. I have taken Statistical Methods 1-4 at JHSPH.

# Five fun facts about me:

1. I love literature. I was an English Literature major as an undergrad and I did my senior thesis on Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse and Mrs. Dalloway.

2. I have three younger siblings.

3. My family has a brown toy poodle named Maggie.

4. I spend a couple weeks every summmer at my family's house on Deer Lake in Grand Rapids, MN. This year my cousin got a video of a family of black bears right outside the front door of the house!

5. My favorite desserts are strawberry ice cream and anything with meringue in it.
